Can I predict which water pumps are faulty?

Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, I predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which don't work at all. 

I Predict one of these three classes based on a number of variables about what kind of pump is operating, when it was installed, and how it is managed. 

A smart understanding of which waterpoints will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.

The data is quite messy but with the programming tools availbale I manage to clean and transform it to actionable insights helping, citizens of Tanzania.

APPROACHES TAKEN: 
1. Data Familirization: I understand the columns in the data and their meaning, I check the data types of the columns, Inconsistencies in the data, misising values, duplicated values, outliers etc.
2. Decide the approcah I will use in dealing with the missing values, inconsistencies, data types and outliers,  -these are but a few of the things that highly impact the accuracy of the insights
   uncovered and the models performance, Therefore, the approach taken is key determinant of the outcomes.
3. With the missing values, I go with the approcah of filling in with the MODE since my columns are categorical, for duplicates I drop them, Outliers I remove them, having detected them using the Z-score approach.
4. I perform the EDA
